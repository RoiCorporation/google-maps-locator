# Google Maps Locator
Simple C program that allows the user search a place from the terminal using the
Google Maps website.

The first version of this program was finished in March 2022. Back then, it was
written in C++ and it could only be run with the Windows operating system. The
code was fully refactored in February 2026 and is now written in C and can be
run on Windows, Mac OS and Linux machines.


## 🚀 Run the program
To run the program, simply compile it with
```gcc google_maps_locator.c -o google_maps_locator``` and then run it by passing
to it the name of the place to be searched, like this:
```./google_maps_locator Madrid```.
